				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment was based on the countless "hacks" or "life pro-tips" found on social media that are often nonsensical. It generates random tips that may or may not be useful.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The generator uses an array of inputs and chooses a random word each time to be generated at a place in the code where a variable ($) is requested. <br><br> To run, press the "New Tip" button at the top to generate a new tip!
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with HTML and CSS was difficult because there were a lot of formatting problems I was unfamiliar with. The Glitch CSS was an example of a struggle I dealt with during this experiment. The JavaScript were much easier to understand and the word generation was made simple because it was based on a set of arrays and replacing the variables with a randomly chosen word. I had an easy time brainstorming the array of words I would use in the generator.</p>
