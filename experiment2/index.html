				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment showcases my work in generating a living impression of an inspiring image using the impressionism art form. This project offers a generative, living impression of this inspiring image:</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspring image:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Color: The sky, grass, trees, mountain, and flower colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the eyedropper tool from PhotoAiD.</li>
					<li>Primitives: The trees are rendered with triangle primitives. The flowers are rendered with ellipse and rectangle primitives.</li>
					<li>Polygons: The background mountain is a single custom-shaped polygon using vertex calls.</li>
					<li>Generativity: Different seed values lead to differently shaped mountains, differently positioned trees, and differently positioned flowers.</li>
					<li>Life: The position of flowers is animated over time as if to simulate wind blowing on the flowers in a back and forth motion.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with p5.js was a lot easier than I expected. I found it difficult to properly place the mountain in the intended area, but when I looked at how vertex calls were being made, it made a lot more sense. Another difficulty I had was having the stem not overlap with other flowers. I tried different checking methods, but they led to less flowers being generated which was not what I wanted. In the end, I kept it there because it gave off a feeling of grass. I had success with creating an abundance of flowers such that it looked like a field because I used many variables that were easily altered which let me easily decide what style I wanted for my flower.</p>
